# Soccer Narrator

Soccer Narrator is an AI-powered project that generates voiceovers for soccer videos. It can generate narrations in different styles and languages, overlay the generated audio on the video, and even generate subtitles.

It's based on the code by https://github.com/ggoonnzzaallo/llm_experiments, but I've changed it so it works with any video on youtube!

## Features

- Video Processing: Extracts frames from a given video and generates a description for each frame.
- Narration Generation: Uses the frame descriptions to generate a narration in the style of a soccer commentator.
- Audio Generation: Converts the generated narration into audio.
- Audio Overlay: Overlays the generated audio on the original video.
- Subtitle Generation: Generates subtitles for the video in different languages.
  How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required Python packages listed in requirements.txt.
3. Obtain an OpenAI API key by signing up on the OpenAI website.
4. Run the narrator.ipynb notebook to generate the narrations and videos.

## Example Outputs

Here are some examples of the outputs generated by the project:

1. Video with English narration and subtitles:
   ![English Narration](outputs/english_subtitles.mp4)

2. Video with Japanese narration and subtitles:
   ![Japanese Narration with Subtitles](outputs/japanese_subtitles.mp4)

## Future work

The current implementation has some limitations. For example, the narration may not always match the video perfectly, and the quality of the narration can vary depending on the quality of the video and the descriptions generated for each frame.
